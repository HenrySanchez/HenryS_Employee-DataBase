employees.gender, 
salaries.salary
FROM employees, salaries
WHERE salaries.emp_no = employees.emp_no

2.List employees who were hired in 1986.

SELECT employees.last_name,

dept_manager.emp_no = employees.emp_no;

4.List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.


SELECT department_employees.emp_no, 
	employees.last_name,

LEFT JOIN departments ON department_employees.dept_no = departments.dept_no;


5.List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
